# MP 

With over 600 Members of Parliament it's impossible to know who they all are and what they stand for.

TheyWorkForYou is a charity that takes data from the UK Parliament, and presents it in a way that's easy to follow. They have a profile for each MP which shows their voting record, appearances and financial donations.

This extension creates a direct link to an MPs profile whenever their name appears on the webpage.
