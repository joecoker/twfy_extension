# MP 

With over 600 Members of Parliament it's impossible to know who they all are and what they stand for.

TheyWorkForYou is a charity that takes data from the UK Parliament, and presents it in a way that's easy to follow. They have a profile for each MP which shows their voting record, appearances and financial donations.

This extension creates a direct link to an MPs profile whenever their name appears on the webpage.

## Installation

This extension is not yet avaiable on the chrome marketplace but you can still run it by downloading the code and uploading it directly to your chrome extensions menu. To do this follow these steps:

1) Download the extension folder from this repository
2) Open chrome and go to your extensions page (chrome://extensions/)
3) Enable Developer mode by toggling the button in the top right hand corner
4) Click Load Unpacked and select the extension folder you downloaded
5) The extension is now installed

## Usage

The extension will highlight all MP's names in green. Clicking on one of these opens that MP's profile in a new tab.
